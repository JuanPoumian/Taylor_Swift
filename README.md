On October 21, 2022, Taylor Swift released her new album, Midnights, I was curious to see if she had hinted about it in her lyrics before the release. Therefore, I analyzed all of her lyrics to discover any references to 'midnight'. In this project, I will be exploring her references to time, including day and night, and using sentiment analysis to study her tone and vibe throughout her career. By the end of the project, I aim to determine whether she writes more positively about day or night.
